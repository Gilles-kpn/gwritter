<strong>Come back to source to jump high</strong>
This is what i thought when i was build <strong>GWRITTER</strong>
Most developper don't write all the source code because the IDE give autocompletion and minimal code
<strong>GWRITTER</strong> is a simple text editor write in Java
It recognize many language code and is simple to use
With <strong>GWRITTER</strong> ,the developper write all the code and in this way will be able to write without IDE
