# gwritter
 **Come back to source to jump high**
This is what I thought when I was building **GWRITTER**\
Most developpers don't write all the source code of their application because the IDE gives auto-completion and minimal code.\
**GWRITTER** is a simple text editor written in Java.\
It recognizes many programming languages and is simple to use.\
With **GWRITTER**, the developper write all the code _by himself_.
## _Try it_
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Gilles-kpn/gwritter
 cd gwritter
 java -jar gwritter.jar
 ```
